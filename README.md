A simple, beautiful and SEO friendly glossary plugin. Place the shortcode wherever you want and display the list of glossary terms wherever you want.

== Description ==
Sweet Glossary is a very simple plugin to use. When you activate the plugin, it creates a Custom Post Type called \"glossary\". From there you can add all the terms you want to the glossary, as simple as creating a new post.

And then what? Just use the shortcode \"[sweetglossary]\" to display the list of terms you have created in your glossary.

The shortcode displays a sweet table with all the terms created in the glossary in alphabetical order and with a link to each of the terms to improve the SEO of your site.

It also inserts a search box to filter all the terms dynamically.

Add the shortcode wherever you want. The recommended way is to insert it in a page, with an SEO optimized title and add an introduction before adding the shortcode.

And that\'s it! Sweet, simple and powerful.
